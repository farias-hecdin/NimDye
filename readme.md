# Nim language support for Vim
This provides minimal [Nim](http://nim-lang.org) language support for Vim:
- Syntax highlighting
- Configuration options
- Filetype autocommands

### Installation
Installing `nim.vim` is the same as installing any other package with a package manager.
Use your favorite manager, and follow their instructions for how to set it up.

### Source
The source of this script comes from https://github.com/zah/nim.vim,  
which comes mainly from http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2632,  
which comes from a modified python.vim (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=790).
